Notes:

1. track daily FII/DII activity from Nse website
2. plot nifty banks,nifty IT,nifty metals etc... wrt to FII/DII activity
3. plot can tell you which sector money is flowing
4. you can also check historical flow of money into sectors
5. once we get to know in which sector money is flowing, we can analyze the stocks taking into accunt support value,fundamentals etc...and invest
6.Can also do by taking the 2 highest market cap of each sector and tracking its share movement on a daily/weekly basis. if there is consistent upward trend of the stock and then sector itself when compared to nifty means FII/DII could be moving their money into that sector
